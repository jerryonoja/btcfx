                <p class="w_color">
                    COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)When it comes to the collection of personal information from children and teenagers under 18, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation’s consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety online.
                    Our Services do not address anyone under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personal identifiable information from children or teenagers under 18 In the case we discover that a child or teenagers under 18 has provided us with personal information, we immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we will be able to do necessary actions.
